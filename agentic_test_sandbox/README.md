# 🧪 Agentic AI System - Test Sandbox

This is a **completely isolated test environment** for testing the agentic AI workflow system.

## 🎯 Purpose

Test the agentic workflow without:
- Making actual API calls
- Persisting any data
- Using API keys
- Incurring costs

## 📁 Files

- **`test_agentic_dry_run.py`** - Dry-run test script that simulates the entire workflow

## 🚀 Run the Test

```bash
cd /workspace/agentic_test_sandbox
python test_agentic_dry_run.py
```

Or from anywhere:
```bash
python /workspace/agentic_test_sandbox/test_agentic_dry_run.py
```

## ✅ What Gets Tested

The dry-run test simulates all 7 phases:

1. **Phase 1:** Load Requirements
   - Checks if prompt files exist
   - Simulates requirements analysis

2. **Phase 2:** System Design
   - Mock architecture design generation

3. **Phase 3:** Design Review
   - Simulated review with different LLM

4. **Phase 4:** Code Development
   - Generates 9 mock code files
   - Simulates file creation

5. **Phase 5:** Code Review
   - Mock quality and security review

6. **Phase 6:** Testing & Refinement
   - Iterative testing simulation
   - Bug fixing simulation

7. **Phase 7:** Final Output
   - Mock output structure generation

## 📊 Expected Output

The test will show:
- ✅ Phase completion status
- 🤖 Agent activity (all 6 agents)
- 📝 Files generated count
- ⏱️  Execution time
- 📊 Statistics

## 🔒 Guarantees

This test:
- ✅ Does NOT make real API calls
- ✅ Does NOT write any files
- ✅ Does NOT persist data
- ✅ Does NOT require API keys
- ✅ Does NOT incur costs
- ✅ Is completely safe to run

## ⚡ Quick Test

```bash
# Run the dry-run test
python /workspace/agentic_test_sandbox/test_agentic_dry_run.py
```

Expected runtime: ~10-15 seconds

## 📝 Test Results

After running, you'll see:
- All 7 phases completed
- ~20+ simulated API calls
- 9 files "generated" (mock)
- Complete workflow validation

## 🎓 Learning

This test helps you:
- Understand the workflow phases
- See agent interactions
- Validate the system works
- Learn the process flow

## 🚀 Next Steps

After successful test:
1. Review the output
2. Understand the workflow
3. Set up API keys in `/workspace/agentic/.env`
4. Run the real workflow: `cd /workspace/agentic && python develop_jira_auth.py`
